This is the readme file for MsqlCGI version 0.8.  It explains quickly how
to setup MsqlCGI.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE read the documentation at the web
site:

	http://petrified.cic.net/MsqlCGI/

This file assumes that you have read the documentation on the site.

If you're reading this file and don't have the full package, you can
ftp the MsqlCGI package from 

	ftp://petrified.cic.net/pub/MsqlCGI

# Installation: #
#################
First off, let me apologize for not having a better installation program
available.  I will create one for the "1.0" version.


1: Copy all the files in the "MsqlCGI-bin" directory to a CGI capable
   directory.  Actually, I recommend that you copy those files into a
   SUB-Directory of your CGI capable directory.  For example:

	cd <MsqlCGI Source Tree>
   	cp -rp MsqlCGI-bin /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/MsqlCGI

2: Copy the files in the "images" to a web accessible HTML directory.

3: Edit the file "MsqlCGI.conf" (which should now be in your CGI capable
   directory as per step 1).

4: Edit the MsqlCGI.pl and CreateDef.pl files.  They have one variable
   that you need to edit:

   	$MSQLCGI_CONF: The full path name to the MsqlCGI.conf file

5: Create a table definition file for your MiniSQL table by running the
   "CreateDef.pl" program from a UNIX command line.  This program is
   interactive, and should not be run with any arguments.  It will create
   a Table Definition file as it's output.  

6: Move the Table Definition file created in step 4 into the directory
   defined in the MsqlCGI.conf file as the  "$defaultTableDefDir"
   variable.

7: From your web browser, run the MsqlCGI program.  The URL should look
   something like: 

   	http://host.domain/path/MsqlCGI.pl?TableDefinitionFileName

   For Example if: 
   
      * You put the MsqlCGI program files in the "cgi-bin/MsqlCGI"
        URL directory 
      * You named your Table Definition file "Test.def".
      * Your host name is ack.somewhere.com

   Your URL would look something like this:

   	http://ack.somewhere.com/cgi-bin/MsqlCGI/MsqlCGI.pl?Test.def

# Sample Database: #
####################

There is a sample database contained in the "SampleDB" directory.  It is
the same database as used in the "Sample Databases" on the official
MsqlCGI site:  

	http://petrified.cic.net/MsqlCGI/SampleDB.html
	
You can use this as your testbed if you would like.  Here are the steps
involved:

1: Perform steps 1-3 from above

2: Create a MiniSQL database called "MsqlCGITest".  Currently, MsqlCGI
   does not have the capability to create tables, so you'll have to use
   the unix "msqladmin" program or something similar.  As root, issue the
   command:

   	msqladmin create MsqlCGITest

3: Add the sample data that's in the file "SampleDB/TestDB.msql" into the
   database.  change directory into the "SampleDB" directory and then
   Issue the command:

   	msql < TestDB.msql

4: From your web browser, run the MsqlCGI program with the name of the
   Table Definition file "TestDB.def".  You can either create the URL with
   the full pathname to the TestDB.def file, or you can copy the
   TestDB.def file into the directory as defined by the
   "$defaultTableDefDir" variable in the MsqlCGI.conf file.


Please remember, MsqlCGI isn't quite finished yet, so some aspects of it
are rather rough around the edges.  I hope to get these worked out as soon
as possible.  

Lastly, if you make changes to the source code, please let me know.  I'm
always up for contributions. :)

If you have any questions, look at the official MsqlCGI web site:

Feel free to send email to me at <altitude@cic.net> as well.

Good Luck!
