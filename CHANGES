Version 0.8
-----------
First "public" beta version.

Lots of code cleanup (although there needs to be a whole lot more).  
No major features added.  

Version 0.7
-----------
Added many options and cleaned up a bunch of code.  This is still mainly
an internal version.  Features Added:
  * HTML Templates
  * Search Options

Scrapped the current version of the SpecialFieldsAPI.  It's not working
properly at all.  I need to figure out a couple more questions before I
continue.


Version 0.6 -> NULL
-------------------
Internal versions.
